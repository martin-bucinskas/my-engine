# myEngine

This is a react-native application built for integration with the company.
This is not an official Engine product and is created to entertain and
train myself during the lock-down.

## Discovery

For this project, I have done a mini discovery. There are a few basic points that
I wanted to clear in the first place, which would help me envision the final
design/product/direction this project is going to.

I have came up with 3 questions which the answers will allow me to branch out
and theorise some concepts.

- What would you want to achieve from 'myEngine' app?
- What integrations would you like to see?
- How often would you use the app?

These questions have been provided to a select few, given just an app name - 'myEngine'.
The rest, is for them to decide, i.e. the use case of the app, what they would
do with the app, and how often they would use it.

#### What would you want to achieve from 'myEngine' app?

This question was asked to grasp a concept what is needed for the business. What would
people like to achieve if they had an app that could do something. How would this affect
them, impact their job in a positive way?

Here are some of the answers:

- Let me see upcoming work events
- Contain my profile
- Helpful links in one place
- Contact information / some sort of telephone directory
- My team page - team local events / notifications

#### What integrations would you like to see?

This question focuses more on the actual functionality with the business body.

Here are some answers:

- Allows me to view my own payslips
- Contain a calendar
- Slack
- Capacity Planner
- Timesheets
- Maps (show notification for my commute to work)

#### How often would you use the app?

This question was asked to get the feel for the need of a tool, would it be used daily,
or only for certain tasks?

Here are some of the answers:

- Would use daily, check latest of whats happening in the company
- Only in mornings, catch up on the last nights news / this mornings news
- Lunch times would be nice to use the app
- Only check it when I receive notifications
